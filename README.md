# My financial report

## Purpose
- Every month I want to know where I spent my money 
- I label each expenditure to some big categories such as 'Auto', 'Groceries', 'Foods', so on.

## Description
- [Finance Summary.ipynb](https://github.com/kkweon/my-spending-report/blob/master/Finance%20Summary.ipynb)
    - This is the main file. It contains my monthly financial report

    - Manually labeling is hard or I am lazy. So, I usually get a help from machine learning
